# Boilerplate of anÂ [Electron](https://electronjs.org)Â desktop application combining [Express](https://expressjs.com)Â and [Angular 7](https://angular.io/)

Nice and steady boilerplate and project structure to combine a stack of Angular and Express.js in an Electron desktop application.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8.x or 10.x (I personally recommend version 10.15.3 LTS)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart) can be installed over `npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Installation
After cloning the repository to your computer, install from the command line:
```
$ cd electron-express-angular && npm install
```

## Usage
You can integrate your own project by copying your angular frontend project into the `angular` folder and your express API into the `express` folder.

Run the Electron desktop application from the command line:
```
npm run start
```

## Party on!
You're all set up for an amanzing and unified coding experience! ðŸŽ‰
